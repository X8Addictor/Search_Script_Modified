# Search_Script_Modified

A modified version of C# script that includes more interactibility with more rigorous parameter input testing and takes in two arguments: <csv_file_path> <column_index>.

Based on the given <column_index>, an unique <search_key> parameter will be requested by the script to specifically search and compare within the specified <column_index>.

After a successful search, it retuns the line which contains the <search_key>.
