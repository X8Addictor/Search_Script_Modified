# Search_Script_Modified

A modified version of C# script that includes more interactibility with more rigorous parameter input testing and takes in two arguments: <csv_file_path> <column_index>, where <csv_file_path> is the path of the csv file, <column_index> is the column to search in.

Based on the given <column_index>, an unique <search_key> parameter will be requested by the script to search and compare within the specified <column_index>.

After a successful search, it retuns the line which contains the <search_key>.

To run the script, open CMD and open the directory in which the "Search.exe" exists, then paste this line within the CMD "Search.exe <csv_file_path> <column_index>", then when requested input the <search_key> exclusive of "" and <> with appropriate arguments.
